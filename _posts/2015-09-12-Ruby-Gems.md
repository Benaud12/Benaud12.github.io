title: Week 2! Ruby Gems.

A Ruby Gem is basically a pre-written library or plug-in that you can install to provide additional functionality to fill a specific need.

Gems can be used to extend or modify functionality in Ruby applications. Commonly theyâ€™re used to distribute reusable functionality that is shared with other Rubyists for use in their applications and libraries. Some gems provide command line utilities to help automate tasks and speed up your work.

Anyone can create and share a Ruby Gem.

Gems are installed using the command line:

```
$ gem install gemname
```

Once installed it can be called using the 'require' keyword at the top of your code. See the example below using the 'sinatra' gem.

The sinatra gem is great for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort.

```
$ gem install sinatra
```

```
# ruby_app.rb

require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  'Ruby, ruby, ruby, ruby! Wooahoohohohohoooh...'
end
```

```
$ ruby ruby_app.rb
```
